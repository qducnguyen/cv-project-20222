# Computer Vision Project: Super-resolution with Flowers Images
# DSAI K65 - HUST

**Note: All the code need to run in this directory.* 

*All the code should be run on one of three platforms Linux OS, Google Colab, and Kaggle to work properly.*

## Environment Setup

We use [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to install Python environment 

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate cv-env
```

**Note: If you use Google Colab or Kaggle, everything is already setup.*
