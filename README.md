# Computer Vision Project: Single Image Super-resolution with Flower Images
# DSAI K65 - HUST

**Note: All the code need to run in this directory.* 

*All the code should be run on one of three platforms Linux OS, Google Colab, and Kaggle to work properly.*

---
## Overview

We implement different algorithms and models for Single Image Super-resolution with Flower Images 

---

## Environment Setup

We use [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to install Python environment 

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate cv-env
```

**Note: If you use Google Colab or Kaggle, everything is already setup.*



## Dataset Preparation and Training Code, you could see the tutorial in the head of each file or through Google Colab
